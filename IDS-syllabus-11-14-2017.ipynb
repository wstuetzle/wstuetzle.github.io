    "# Syllabus for Introduction to Data Science\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructor\n",
    "\n",
    "Werner Stuetzle  (wxs@uw.edu)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Course description\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduction to Data Science (IDS) is a survey course introducing the\n",
    "essential elements of data science: data collection and management;\n",
    "summarizing and visualizing data; basic ideas of statistical\n",
    "inference; machine learning. Students will gain hands-on experience\n",
    "using the Python programming language and Jupyter notebooks. IDS can be viewed as a hybrid between a computing course focused on programming and algorithms and a statistics course focusing on estimation and inference. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "* Many important decisions made by individuals and society at\n",
    "  large are or should be data driven. Therefore, understanding the\n",
    "  fundamentals of data science is essential for functioning as an\n",
    "  informed citizen.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Basic understanding and hands-on experience with manipulating,\n",
    "  analyzing, and presenting data are increasingly important during \n",
    "  education and in the workplace.\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "Students completing STAT 180 should be able to\n",
    "* list the steps involved in data science from data acquisition to\n",
    "  insight and describe the role of each step;\n",
    "\n",
    "* distinguish different ways of collecting data and their impact on the\n",
    "  conclusions that can be drawn from the data;\n",
    "\n",
    "* manage, summarize and visualize data using the Python\n",
    "  programming language and Jupyter notebooks;\n",
    "\n",
    "* explain the basic concepts of statistial inference and\n",
    "  implement simulation based inference methods;\n",
    "\n",
    "* apply machine learning methods and assess the quality of\n",
    "  predictions.\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Target audience\n",
    "\n",
    "All undergraduates, not just students with primary interest in science\n",
    "or engineering. No previous exposure to programming or statistics is\n",
    "expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Minimum prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Either a minimum grade of 2.5 in MATH 098, a minimum grade of 3.0 in\n",
    "MATH 103, a score of 151-169 on the MPT-GS placement test, or score of\n",
    "145-153 on the MPT-AS placement test.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approximate time allocation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Introduction to Python; data management, description, visualization: 4 weeks\n",
    "2. Data collection and inference: 3 weeks\n",
    "3. Machine learning: 2 weeks\n",
    "4. Industrial strength data science: 1 week\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Course materials\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Computational and Inferential Thinking\" by Ani Adhikari and John\n",
    "  DeNero. Free download from https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/intro\n",
    "  \n",

    "\n",
    "### Technology\n",
    "\n",
    "Python and Jupyter notebooks will be used for class notes, in-class\n",
    "demos, homeworks, and labs. Students will have access to a JupyterHub\n",
    "allowing them to work with notebooks through a web browser. While\n",
    "Python is available free of charge for those wo wish to install it on\n",
    "their private computers, doing so is not required.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Access and Accommodations\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have already established accommodations with Disability\n",
    "Resources for Students (DRS), please communicate your approved\n",
    "accommodations to me at your earliest convenience so we can discuss\n",
    "your needs in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have not yet established services through DRS, but have a\n",
    "temporary health condition or permanent disability that requires\n",
    "accommodations (conditions include but not limited to; mental health,\n",
    "attention-related, learning, vision, hearing, physical or health\n",
    "impacts), you are welcome to contact DRS at 206-543-8924 or\n",
    "uwdrs@uw.edu or disability.uw.edu. DRS offers resources and\n",
    "coordinates reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities\n",
    "and/or temporary health conditions.  Reasonable accommodations are\n",
    "established through an interactive process between you, your\n",
    "instructor(s) and DRS.  It is the policy and practice of the\n",
